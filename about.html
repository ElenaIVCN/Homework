            <div>Rocky is a 3 year old German Shepard. He came into our lives, adopted from a shelter. He is the most energetic, loving and playful dog you can imagine.</div>
            His favorite game is fetch, and he takes a break only to drink some water and then he's ready to rumble again.
            Our bad boy doesn't spend his time alone, nooo; he has a wife named Kara, who he seems to love very much, but don't pet her in front of him, beacause this jelous little devil will chase her away, until he has all your attention.
